Welcome to BookLoom 
BookLoom is a website designed to be a community forum for book lovers. 
Anonymous users can view the Book Library but the website allows/requires users to create accounts if they want to make changes to the community book list 
the intent behind this website is to join people in their love of books and widen peoples reading avenues 
helping them to discover new books they normaly wouldn't have picked up 
we hope in the future allow users to create profiles and connect with eachother about their book interests
